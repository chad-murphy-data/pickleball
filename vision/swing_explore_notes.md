# swing_explore — exploration-mode results (2026-08-16/17)

**Status: EXPLORATION, not a verdict.** This is the "take away the
hard-science rigor for a minute" thread the user opened after the Gate C
RTMPose diagnostic came back KILL (ceiling 45.1% @2x budget, ±0.30 s —
`data/vision/contact_ceiling_report_rtm.json`). Everything here is fit
and evaluated on the same 10 labeled rallies (162 contacts,
`data/vision/contact_labels_chicago0725.csv`) with leave-one-rally-out
cross-validation, RTMPose-balanced pose stream (`pose_rtm/` on the
user's Mac). Nothing in this file passes or fails contact_gate.md; any
result we come to believe graduates to a fresh pre-registration on
untouched rallies (11–16+).

## What the script does

`vision/swing_explore.py` (BUILD banner is versioned; run history below).
Three layers:

1. **Learned swing scorer** — logistic regression (numpy, no sklearn) on
   jitter-aware pose features per candidate peak: an *early* window
   [−0.75, −0.35] s (preparation — the user's "I can tell who's swinging
   next many frames before contact") and a *core* window [−0.35, +0.35] s,
   torso-relative arm-joint speeds, near/far aware. Negatives are
   guard-banded non-contact moments + matched other-side windows +
   locomotion-peak hard negatives; whiffs excluded from both classes.
   Metric: coverage@2× budget, ranked by learned score instead of raw
   peak height.
2. **Alternation-prior decoder** (the user's "assume alternating swings
   until the rally is over" idea) — serve-anchored side mapping, then a
   DP over candidates that enforces strict side alternation, cadence
   priors on inter-swing gaps, ghost placeholders (parity-keeping,
   max 2), and a span constraint forcing the path to reach the last
   confident candidate in the rally.
3. **Drift sweep** — labels slid ±0.8 s per rally to test whether weak
   rallies are misalignment artifacts.

## Run history (user's Mac, python3, pose_rtm stream)

| build | change | headline |
|---|---|---|
| v1 | first learned scorer | coverage@2× **54.9%** (vs 45.1% height-ranked) |
| v2 | numeric guards, serve-anchored mapping, prep/strike ablation | 46.9% (ablation leaked; optimizer hot) |
| v3/v3.1 | optimizer fixed; Accelerate BLAS warning noise suppressed | **56.2%**, stable; drift sweep FLAT (weak rallies r9/r10 not alignment artifacts) |
| v4 | alternation decoder | sequence precision 72.9% but quits early (r9: 1 of 29 decoded) |
| v5 | span constraint (alternate until the rally is over) | decoded coverage 43.2%, precision 51.1%, ghosts 24, **decoded count 161 vs 162 true** |

v5 per-rally count deltas: r1 −5, r2 +2, r3 +7, r4 +3, r5 −3, r6 −2,
r7 +7, r8 +6, r9 −10, r10 −6.

## The stable picture (held across every configuration)

- **Attacks are learnable and near-ceiling**: speed-up 9/9, smash 9/10
  in the raw ceiling; the learned scorer keeps them ~80–100%.
- **The soft kitchen game is the wall**: dinks ~41%, counters ~32% raw;
  ~45–50% under every scorer variant. This is genuinely stream-side at
  RTMPose/720p — orientation oracle ≈ headline (killed that hypothesis),
  drift sweep flat (killed misalignment), candidate-any 71% vs @2× 45%
  says the *selector* binds at budget but the missing soft contacts are
  weak or absent in the arm-speed stream itself.
- **Count vs placement split (v5's lesson)**: the alternation decoder
  with a span constraint gets rally *shot counts* nearly exact
  (161 vs 162 total) while only ~half the decoded events land on a true
  contact within tolerance. Turn-order/shot-count analytics are much
  closer than exact-timestamp contact attribution.
- Prediction ledger: I predicted v5 decoded coverage would beat 56.2%
  and precision would rise — **both wrong**. The span constraint trades
  precision for completeness; it commits through stretches where the
  stream has nothing.

## Remaining levers (in order of expected value)

1. **ViTPose A/B** — after the Colab run (gpu_runbook.md Cell 4), rerun
   `swing_explore.py --pose-dir pose`. The one untested instrument
   question: does a stronger pose backbone put the soft kitchen contacts
   into the stream at all?
2. **Rallies 11–16 labels** (11–12 fast-heavy) — more dev data; 10
   rallies is thin for anything beyond this coarse picture.
3. **Temporal model class** (sequence model over frames instead of
   per-peak logistic) — only worth building if (1) or (2) moves the
   soft-shot number.

Constant-tuning further on these 10 rallies is over — the numbers above
are the plateau.
